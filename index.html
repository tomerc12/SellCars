    <h3>information about cars</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily
    on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2] French
    inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss
    inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile
    in 1808.
